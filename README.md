## Features

- **Custom Database Table**: The plugin creates a custom database table with fields for ID, name, and email to store data.

- **Admin Page**: It includes an admin page accessible from the WordPress dashboard.

- **Data Display**: The main admin page displays all data in a table format. Each row of data is accompanied by two buttons or links labeled “Edit” and “Delete.”

- **Add New Data**: Above the table, there is a button labeled “Add new data” that, when clicked, displays a form for adding new data.

- **Edit Data**: Clicking on the “Edit” button loads the corresponding data into the form, allowing users to modify and update it.
